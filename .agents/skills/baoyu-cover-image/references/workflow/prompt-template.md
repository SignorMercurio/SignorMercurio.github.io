[Watermark section if enabled]

[Reference images section if provided — REQUIRED, see below]
```

## Reference-Driven Design ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

When reference images are provided, they are the **primary visual input** and MUST strongly influence the output. The cover should look like it belongs to the same visual family as the references.

**Passing `--ref` alone is NOT enough.** Image generation models often ignore reference images unless the prompt text explicitly describes what to reproduce. Always combine `--ref` with detailed textual instructions.

## Content-Driven Design

- Article title and summary inform the visual metaphor choice
- Keywords guide decorative elements and symbols
- The skill controls visual style; the content drives meaning

## Visual Element Selection

Match content themes to icon vocabulary:

| Content Theme | Suggested Elements |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Programming/Dev | Code window, terminal, API brackets, gear |
| AI/ML | Brain, neural network, robot, circuit |
| Growth/Business | Chart, rocket, plant, mountain, arrow |
| Security | Lock, shield, key, fingerprint |
| Communication | Speech bubble, megaphone, mail, handshake |
| Tools/Methods | Wrench, checklist, pencil, puzzle |

## Type-Specific Composition

| Type | Composition Guidelines |
|------|------------------------|
| `hero` | Large focal visual (60-70% area), title overlay on visual, dramatic composition |
| `conceptual` | Abstract shapes representing core concepts, information hierarchy, clean zones |
| `typography` | Title as primary element (40%+ area), minimal supporting visuals, strong hierarchy |
| `metaphor` | Concrete object/scene representing abstract idea, symbolic elements, emotional resonance |
| `scene` | Atmospheric environment, narrative elements, mood-setting lighting and colors |
| `minimal` | Single focal element, generous whitespace (60%+), essential shapes only |

## Title Guidelines

When text level includes title:
- **Source**: Use the exact title provided by user, or extract from source content
- **Do NOT invent titles**: Stay faithful to the original
- Match confirmed language

## Watermark Application

If enabled in preferences, add to prompt:

```
Include a subtle watermark "[content]" positioned at [position].
The watermark should be legible but not distracting from the main content.
```

Reference: `config/watermark-guide.md`

## Reference Image Handling

When user provides reference images (`--ref` or pasted images):

### ⚠️ CRITICAL - Frontmatter References

**MUST add `references` field in YAML frontmatter** when reference files are saved to `refs/`:

```yaml
---
type: cover
palette: warm
rendering: flat-vector
references:
  - ref_id: 01
    filename: refs/ref-01-podcast-thumbnail.jpg
    usage: style
---
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ref_id` | Sequential number (01, 02, ...) |
| `filename` | Relative path from prompt file's parent directory |
| `usage` | `direct` / `style` / `palette` |

**Omit `references` field entirely** if no reference files saved (style extracted verbally only).

### When to Include References in Frontmatter

| Situation | Frontmatter Action | Generation Action |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Reference file saved to `refs/` | Add to `references` list ✓ | Pass via `--ref` parameter |
| Style extracted verbally (no file) | Omit `references` field | Describe in prompt body only |
| File path in frontmatter but doesn't exist | ERROR - fix or remove | Generation will fail |

**Before writing prompt with references, verify**: `test -f refs/ref-NN-{slug}.{ext}`

### Reference Usage Types

| Usage | When to Use | Generation Action |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `direct` | Reference matches desired output closely | Pass to `--ref` parameter |
| `style` | Extract visual style characteristics only | Describe style in prompt text |
| `palette` | Extract color palette only | Include colors in prompt |

### Step 1: Analyze References

For each reference image, extract:
- **Style**: Rendering technique, line quality, texture
- **Composition**: Layout, visual hierarchy, focal points
- **Color mood**: Palette characteristics (without specific colors)
- **Elements**: Key visual elements and symbols used

### Step 2: Embed in Prompt ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Passing `--ref` alone is NOT enough.** Image generation models frequently ignore reference images unless the prompt text explicitly and forcefully describes what to reproduce. You MUST always write detailed textual instructions regardless of whether `--ref` is used.

**If file saved (with or without `--ref` support)**:
- Pass ref images via `--ref` parameter if skill supports it
- **ALWAYS** add a detailed mandatory section in the prompt body:

```
# Reference Style — MUST INCORPORATE

CRITICAL: The generated cover MUST visually reference the provided images. The cover must feel like it belongs to the same visual family.

## From Ref 1 ([filename]) — REQUIRED elements:
- [Brand element]: [Specific description of logo/wordmark treatment, e.g., "The logo uses vertical parallel lines (|||) for the letter 'm'. Reproduce this exact treatment."]
- [Signature pattern]: [Specific description, e.g., "Woven intersecting curves forming a diamond/lozenge grid pattern. This MUST appear prominently as a banner, border, or background section."]
- [Colors]: [Exact hex values, e.g., "Dark teal #2D4A3E background, cream #F5F0E0 text"]
- [Typography]: [Specific treatment, e.g., "Uppercase text with wide letter-spacing"]
- [Layout element]: [Specific spatial element, e.g., "Bottom banner strip in dark color"]

## From Ref 1 ([filename]) — Characters (if people present):
- **Character 1**: [Appearance, e.g., "Woman, long wavy blonde hair"] → MUST stylize: [e.g., "flat-vector, simplified face, keep blonde hair, label: 'Nicole Forsgren'"]
- **Character 2**: [Appearance, e.g., "Man, short dark hair, stubble"] → MUST stylize: [e.g., "flat-vector, simplified face, keep dark hair, label: 'Gergely Orosz'"]
- **Placement**: [e.g., "Right third, side by side, facing left toward main visual"]
- **Style**: Match rendering style, NOT photorealistic

## From Ref 2 ([filename]) — REQUIRED elements:
[Same detailed breakdown]

## Integration approach:
[Specific layout instruction describing how reference elements combine with the cover content, e.g., "Use a SPLIT LAYOUT: main illustration area (warm cream background) occupies ~65% of the image, while a dark teal BANNER STRIP (with the woven line pattern from Ref 2) runs along the bottom ~35%, containing branding elements from Ref 1."]
```

**Key rules**:
- Each visual element gets its own bullet with "MUST" or "REQUIRED"
- Descriptions must be **specific enough to reproduce** — not vague ("clean style")
- The integration approach must describe **exact spatial arrangement**
- After generation, verify reference elements are visible; if not, strengthen and regenerate

**If style/palette extracted verbally (NO file saved)**:
- DO NOT add references metadata to prompt
- Append extracted info directly to prompt body using the same MUST INCORPORATE format above:

```
# Reference Style — MUST INCORPORATE (extracted from visual analysis)

CRITICAL: Apply these specific visual elements extracted from the reference images.

## REQUIRED elements:
- [Same detailed bullet format as above]

## Integration approach:
[Same spatial layout instruction]
```

### Reference Analysis Template

Use this format when analyzing reference images. Extract **specific, concrete, reproducible** details — not vague summaries.

| Aspect | Analysis Points | Good Example | Bad Example |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Brand elements** | Logos, wordmarks, distinctive typography | "Logo 'm' formed by 3 vertical lines" | "Has a logo" |
| **Signature patterns** | Unique motifs, textures, geometric patterns | "Woven curves forming diamond grid" | "Has patterns" |
| **Colors** | Exact hex values or close approximations | "#2D4A3E dark teal, #F5F0E0 cream" | "Dark and light" |
| **Layout** | Spatial zones, banner placement, proportions | "Bottom 30% is dark banner with branding" | "Has a banner" |
| **Typography** | Font style, weight, case, spacing, position | "Uppercase, wide letter-spacing, right-aligned" | "Has text" |
| **Rendering** | Line quality, texture, depth treatment | "Topographic contour lines as background texture" | "Clean style" |
| **Elements** | Icon vocabulary, decorative motifs | "Geometric intersecting line ornaments at corners" | "Has decorations" |

**Output**: Each extracted element should be written as a **copy-pasteable prompt instruction** prefixed with "MUST" or "REQUIRED".
